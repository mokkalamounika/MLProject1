Machine Learning Project - 1: Building a Prediction model for banking loan approval info for a Nationalized Bank.

Distribution of the loans is the core business part of almost every bank. The major portion of the bank’s assets directly came from the profit earned from the loans distributed by the banks. Today many banks and financial companies approve loans after a rigorous process of 
verification and validation but still there is no surety whether the chosen applicant is the deserving right applicant out of all applicants. This is project one of the bank wanted to build a model to predict whether that particular applicant’s loan can be approved or rejected.

VARIABLES  	     with        VARIABLE DESCRIPTION

APP_ID     	             Application id’s

CIBIL_SCORE_VALUE 	     Cibil score is the three digits  (0=bad,1=0k,2=good)

NEW_CUST	               New To Credit score will help banks rate new borrowers (Y/N)

CUS_ATGCODE 	           Customer category code i.e. existing or new customer

EMPLOYMENT_TYPE          Gives the type of employment i.e. salaried =1,or self employed=0

Age                      Age of the applicant

SEX  	                   Gender of the person, “F” & “M”

NO_OF_DEPENDENTS 	       Dependents of the applicant.

MARITAL _Status	         Marital Status of the applicant 1-Married 0- not Married

EDU_QUA	                 Educational qualifications of the applicants (1=educated, 0=not-educated)

P_RESTYPE                Type of Residence of the applicant 1=Own, 0=Rented

P_CATEGORY               Type of house the applicant stays in.

EMPLOYEE_TYPE 	         Gives the type of employment 0=Private, 1=Temp, 2=Government

MON_IN_OCC 	             Months in working in present employment

INCOME_EXP_GMI	         Income Expenses based rating

ASSET_LOAN_RATIO	       Pre-calculation based asset & loan ratio

TENURE 	                 Loan tenure ranges from 12 to 48

Status	                 Loan approved or rejected (1/0)



   Based on the above fields students has to create data and develop a prediction model for loan approval/rejection.
